# Historical Analysis of Equity and Dividend Returns: Time Series Patterns and Autocorrelation Insights
This project conducts a **historical analysis of US equity and dividend returns** using monthly data from **January 1871 to September 2016**. The objective is to compute **percentage monthly log returns** for both equities and dividends, identifying their time series characteristics. By applying **logarithmic transformations**, the analysis aims to normalize the data and assess its volatility over time. The computed returns are then visualized to observe trends, fluctuations, and potential cyclical patterns in equity markets and dividend payments.  

To further analyze the **statistical properties** of the data, we generate and compare the **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots** for both equity and dividend returns. These functions help determine the **persistence of past values** in the time series, indicating whether returns exhibit **momentum or mean-reverting behavior**. A key focus is to **interpret differences in autocorrelation structures**, which may suggest fundamental distinctions between the nature of equity price movements and dividend distributions.  

The findings from this project provide valuable insights into the **behavior of financial returns**, particularly in **long-term investment strategies and risk assessment**. By understanding how past returns influence future movements, investors and analysts can make informed decisions regarding **portfolio allocation, dividend-based strategies, and market cycle dynamics**. The projectâ€™s methodology and results can be further extended to **forecasting models and financial risk management applications**.

## Objective  

The analysis aims to:  
- Compute **monthly log returns** for equity and dividends.  
- Visualize the **time series patterns** of returns.  
- Examine **Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF)** plots to assess return persistence.  
- Compare the statistical behavior of **equity price movements vs. dividend distributions**.

## Key Findings  

1. **Time Series Patterns**: Equity returns exhibit **higher volatility** compared to dividend returns, which are more stable.  
2. **Autocorrelation Insights**: Equity returns show limited autocorrelation, whereas dividend returns display stronger persistence over time.  
3. **Market Behavior**: The findings highlight key differences in **price-driven fluctuations vs. dividend-based stability**, helping in investment strategy decisions.
